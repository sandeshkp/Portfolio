<h1>Sales Performance Dashboard & Analytics Platform</h1>

<div class="highlight-box">
A centralized analytics system built to replace fragmented, email-driven reporting
with real-time, hierarchy-based business insights across India.
</div>

<hr>

<h2>1. Project Context</h2>
<p>
The organization operates with a complex, nationwide sales hierarchy consisting of
Dealers reporting to Area Sales Managers (ASMs), ASMs reporting to Regional Sales
Managers (RSMs), and regional leadership overseeing performance across multiple
states. The product portfolio spans a wide range of categories and subcategories,
making data consolidation and reporting inherently complex.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Challenges Identified</h2>
<div class="timeline">
  <p>• Sales, stock, and production data existed in multiple disconnected formats</p>
  <p>• Depot-wise stock, cut cases, and launch-pending reports were emailed individually</p>
  <p>• Large image-based reports caused mail server load and storage issues</p>
  <p>• Month-end PPTs were manually prepared by sales teams, impacting daily operations</p>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>3. Solution Approach</h2>
<p>
A lightweight Flask-based analytical application was developed, supported by a
heavy-duty backend ETL pipeline. The frontend focuses purely on data consumption
and visualization, while all computationally intensive processing is handled
upstream.
</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
<b>Automation-first design:</b> zero manual intervention after daily data arrival.
</div>

<hr>

<h2>4. Data Pipeline & Architecture</h2>
<p>
Every morning, previous-day sales, stock, supply chain, and production data is
received via FTP from SAP HANA systems. This data undergoes validation,
transformation, aggregation, and enrichment as part of an automated ETL workflow.
</p>

<div class="timeline">
  <p>• SAP HANA → FTP ingestion</p>
  <p>• Automated transformation & validation</p>
  <p>• Generation of 100+ analytical reports (including image mapping)</p>
  <p>• Storage in MySQL and shared servers</p>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>5. Platform Capabilities</h2>
<p>
<span class="badge">Sales Analytics</span>
<span class="badge">Stock Visibility</span>
<span class="badge">Supply Chain Tracking</span>
<span class="badge">Production Insights</span>
<span class="badge">FY-wise History</span>
</p>

<p>
Users access the finalized analytical outputs through the Flask application,
eliminating dependency on emails and static presentations. Over time, selective
operational windows such as stock updates and allotment views were introduced to
enhance usability without compromising analytical performance.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>6. Business Impact</h2>
<p>
The platform significantly reduced reporting time, infrastructure overhead, and
manual effort. Stakeholders now access near real-time insights instead of waiting
for month-end summaries, enabling proactive decision-making at all levels of the
sales hierarchy.
</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
Result: Faster decisions · Lower operational load · Consistent metrics · Scalable analytics
</div>

<hr>

<h2>7. UI / UX Representation</h2>
<p>
Only representative, non-sensitive mock screens are used to demonstrate navigation,
filters, and report structure. No proprietary data, metrics, or visuals are exposed.
</p>
