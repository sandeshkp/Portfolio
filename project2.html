<h1>Sales Performance Dashboard & Analytics Platform</h1>

<h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
<p>
This project is an internal, enterprise-level sales analytics and reporting platform
designed to centralize and standardize sales, stock, supply chain, and production
visibility across the organization. The system was built to support a highly
distributed sales structure operating across multiple states in India, with a
hierarchy consisting of Dealers reporting to ASMs, ASMs reporting to RSMs, and
regional leadership overseeing overall performance.
</p>
<p>
The platform was implemented as a lightweight Flask-based web application on the
frontend, supported by a robust and heavily automated backend ETL pipeline. While
the application itself is analytical in nature rather than transactional, it
processes large volumes of data daily to deliver near real-time insights to business
users.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Business Problem</h2>
<p>
Before the implementation of this system, sales and operational data existed across
multiple disconnected sources and formats, covering a wide range of product
categories, subcategories, and regions. Detailed depot-level stock information,
pending product details, cut-case reports, launch-pending status, and image-based
product reports were generated and shared manually.
</p>
<p>
These reports were distributed via email to individual users across the organization.
Due to the volume and complexity of the data, emails often included large attachments
containing product images, resulting in gigabytes of data being circulated daily.
This led to significant challenges related to mail server load, storage limitations,
and user inbox management.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, during month-end and regional sales review meetings, presentation decks
were prepared manually by sales personnel in each state. This process not only
consumed substantial time but also disrupted daily operational responsibilities and
introduced inconsistencies in reporting formats and metrics.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Solution Architecture</h2>
<p>
To address these challenges, a centralized analytics platform was designed with a
clear separation between data processing and data presentation layers.
</p>
<p>
The backend consists of a fully automated ETL pipeline that integrates with SAP HANA
and FTP servers. Every morning, previous-day data related to sales, stock, supply
chain movements, and production is received via FTP. This data is ingested,
validated, transformed, and aggregated into multiple analytical datasets.
</p>
<p>
More than 100 structured and image-enriched analytical reports are generated during
this process. The processed outputs are stored both in a MySQL database for
structured querying and in shared server folders for archival and external access.
</p>
<p>
The Flask application consumes only the finalized analytical outputs, ensuring that
the frontend remains lightweight and responsive. Since the application is primarily
analytical, the design focuses on fast data retrieval, filtering, and visualization
rather than transactional workflows. Over time, selective operational features such
as stock updates and allotment windows were integrated to enhance usability.
</p>

<h2>4. Key Features</h2>
<p>
• Centralized access to sales, stock, production, and supply chain analytics<br>
• Automated daily data ingestion from SAP HANA via FTP<br>
• Generation of 100+ standardized analytical reports with image mapping<br>
• Hierarchical visibility for Dealers, ASMs, RSMs, and regional leadership<br>
• Historical data retention with financial year–wise tracking<br>
• Reduction of email-based reporting and manual PPT preparation
</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. Impact & Outcomes</h2>
<p>
The implementation of this platform resulted in a significant reduction in manual
effort, time consumption, and infrastructure strain. Reporting that previously
required extensive email communication and manual compilation is now accessible
through a centralized system.
</p>
<p>
Users can access near real-time insights instead of waiting for month-end reports,
enabling proactive decision-making. The platform also maintains historical data
across financial years, allowing leadership to analyze long-term trends and
performance patterns.
</p>
<p>
Overall, the solution drastically reduced operational overhead, improved data
consistency, eliminated redundant reporting workflows, and enabled a scalable and
future-ready analytics ecosystem aligned with the organization’s growth.
</p>

<h2>6. UI / UX Snapshots (Dummy Screens)</h2>
<p>
Representative, non-sensitive mockups are used to illustrate dashboard layouts,
filters, and report navigation without exposing proprietary data, internal metrics,
or confidential visual assets.
