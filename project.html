<h1>Production Planning Software (PPS)</h1>

<h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
<p>
The Production Planning Software (PPS) is an internal, Flask-based web application
designed to support daily production and mould planning operations across
manufacturing units. The application is optimized for controlled internal usage,
with peak access occurring during scheduled planning windows.
</p>
<p>
The system converts dealer requirements and historical sales data into structured
production plans, enabling planners to determine the appropriate mould, machine,
and production sequence for each day. By automating this workflow, the application
ensures consistency, accuracy, and faster decision-making in production setup.
</p>

<h2>2. Business Motivation</h2>
<p>
Prior to this system, production planning was performed manually by a small number
of personnel at each manufacturing unit. Demand inputs were received from multiple
states in the form of Excel sheets, followed by extensive coordination through
phone calls and manual adjustments.
</p>
<p>
Frequent intervention from regional sales teams to prioritize high-demand products
often resulted in abrupt production changes. This led to machine stoppages,
inefficient mould changes, and operational confusion during peak hours.
</p>
<p>
A critical operational requirement was to ensure that machines operate continuously,
as unplanned mould changes or idle time directly impacted productivity. Machines
also vary by compatibility (PU, Non-PU, etc.), and plants operate under different
layouts such as linear and circular configurations, which required systematic
handling.
</p>
<p>
The overarching objective was to ensure the daily production of market-relevant
products while minimizing stockouts, excess inventory, and non-moving or defective
stock accumulation.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Impact & Outcomes</h2>
<p>
The most significant outcome of the Production Planning Software is a substantial
improvement in operational efficiency and planning accuracy.
</p>
<p>
Earlier, production plans were typically finalized with a one-day delay due to
manual consolidation and coordination efforts, consuming nearly half a working day.
</p>
<p>
With the introduction of PPS, production planning is now live, standardized, and
data-driven, resulting in an estimated reduction of planning time by approximately
90%. The system enables uninterrupted machine utilization and provides clear
visibility into upcoming production sequences.
</p>
<p>
Operators and planners can easily identify the next product to be produced, the
appropriate mould, required production cycles, and machine availability. Overall,
the system has contributed to improved reliability, cost efficiency, and alignment
between production output and market demand.
</p>

<h2>4. UI / UX Snapshots (Dummy Screens)</h2>
<p>
Representative mockups and non-sensitive sample screens are used to demonstrate
application workflows and user interaction patterns, without exposing proprietary
data or internal system details.
