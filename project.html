    <h1>1) PRODUCTION PLANNING SOFTWARE</h1>

    <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project is built in <strong>Flask software</strong> — lightweight but capable of handling <strong>large data volumes</strong>. 
      The number of users accessing this software at a time is limited, mostly during specific hours in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project focuses on <strong>daily production/mould planning</strong>, where product norms and requirements are received 
      from dealers based on previous sales. This project simplifies and speeds up the process of planning production or 
      machine setup according to the moulds generated by the software, based on daily norms and requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Business Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      This project was initiated to solve challenges in production planning, which was previously managed by one or two 
      people in each production unit across the country. They used to receive requirements and norms from their respective 
      states in the form of Excel sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, they often received frequent calls from ASM/RSMs of each state to stop or change production for 
      high-demand products, creating confusion and frequent machine stoppages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main concern was that <strong>machines should not stop</strong> — they must run <strong>24/7</strong> with a relevant mould running 
      inside. Some machines also face shutdowns due to electrical or mechanical issues, which must be identified. 
      Each machine has specific mould compatibility (for example, PU, Non-PU, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also <strong>linear and circular machine plants</strong>, which need to be managed separately. The main goal is to 
      ensure relevant products are produced daily, avoiding <strong>stockouts</strong> or <strong>cut cases</strong> (non-relevant, unsold, or 
      defective products stored without use).
    </p>

    <h2>3. Impact & Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
      The primary and most significant benefit achieved through this project is <strong>time efficiency</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously, production planning required individuals to collect data from RSMs, ASMs, and dealers across states. 
      The plan was prepared manually, involving multiple calls, consuming almost half a day, and always planning one day 
      behind the actual demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this project, production planning has become <strong>live and standardized</strong>, reducing the planning time by 
      <strong>around 90%</strong> compared to the previous process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Machines now operate continuously without unnecessary stoppage. The software helps identify and utilize each machine 
      effectively. Workers can now easily view which product is next, which mould to use, how many rotations to run, and 
      which machines are inactive — making the entire system <strong>reliable, cost-effective, and market-relevant</strong>.
